This is a simple web page built with HTML and CSS that showcases some basic styling techniques and layout structures.

## Getting Started

To view the web page, simply open `Rr.html` file in your web browser.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the web page consists of the following elements:

- `<header>`: contains the site logo and navigation menu.
- `<main>`: contains the main content of the page.
- `<section>`: contains a featured article with an image and a summary.
- `<aside>`: contains a list of recent articles.
- `<footer>`: contains some copyright information and links to social media.

The HTML also includes some basic form elements, such as `<input>` and `<button>`.

## CSS Styling

The CSS code is organized into several sections that target different aspects of the web page:

- Typography: sets the font family, size, weight, and line height for the text elements.
- Colors: sets the background color, text color, and accent color of the web page.
- Layout: sets the width, margin, padding, and positioning of the different sections and elements.
- Navigation: styles the navigation menu and its links.
- Article: styles the featured article and its image.
- Sidebar: styles the recent articles list.
- Forms: styles the form elements, such as input fields and buttons.
- Responsive: sets some media queries to adjust the layout and styling for smaller screens.

The CSS code also uses some advanced CSS techniques, such as flexbox and pseudo-elements, to create more complex layouts and effects.

##Sure, here's a simple README for the JavaScript file:

# AuthModule.js

This JavaScript module provides a simple login/signup functionality for a web page. It listens for form submissions and logs the input values to the console.

## Usage

1. Include the `AuthModule.js` file in your HTML file, after the `jQuery` and `Bootstrap` dependencies:

```html```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="AuthModule.js"></script>
```

2. Call the `init()` method of the `AuthModule` module after the DOM is ready:

```html```

<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    AuthModule.init();
  });
</script>
```

3. Add the `login-form` and `signup-form` IDs to the login and signup forms, respectively:

`html`

<form id="login-form">
  <!-- Login form fields -->
</form>

<form id="signup-form">
  <!-- Signup form fields -->
</form>
```

4. Customize the `handleLoginSubmit()` and `handleSignupSubmit()` functions in the `AuthModule` module to suit your needs:

javascript
function handleLoginSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  const email = document.querySelector("#login-email").value;
  const password = document.querySelector("#login-password").value;
  console.log(`Login form submitted with email: ${email} and password: ${password}`);
}

function handleSignupSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  const name = document.querySelector("#signup-name").value;
  const phone = document.querySelector("#signup-phone").value;
  const email = document.querySelector("#signup-email").value;
  const password = document.querySelector("#signup-password").value;
  console.log(`Signup form submitted with name: ${name}, phone: ${phone}, email: ${email} and password: ${password}`);
}

## Dependencies

- jQuery v3.6.0
- Bootstrap v4.5.0
