This is a simple web page built with HTML and CSS that showcases some basic styling techniques and layout structures.

## Getting Started

To view the web page, simply open `Rr.html` file in your web browser.

## HTML Structure

The HTML structure of the web page consists of the following elements:

- `<header>`: contains the site logo and navigation menu.
- `<main>`: contains the main content of the page.
- `<section>`: contains a featured article with an image and a summary.
- `<aside>`: contains a list of recent articles.
- `<footer>`: contains some copyright information and links to social media.

The HTML also includes some basic form elements, such as `<input>` and `<button>`.

## CSS Styling

The CSS code is organized into several sections that target different aspects of the web page:

- Typography: sets the font family, size, weight, and line height for the text elements.
- Colors: sets the background color, text color, and accent color of the web page.
- Layout: sets the width, margin, padding, and positioning of the different sections and elements.
- Navigation: styles the navigation menu and its links.
- Article: styles the featured article and its image.
- Sidebar: styles the recent articles list.
- Forms: styles the form elements, such as input fields and buttons.
- Responsive: sets some media queries to adjust the layout and styling for smaller screens.

The CSS code also uses some advanced CSS techniques, such as flexbox and pseudo-elements, to create more complex layouts and effects.
